# Reycling/Sorting System 

In this repository, you can find the code and libraries (provided to the team) used for a course project. The goal of the project is to simulate the movement of a
Q-arm using Quanser Interactive Labs to correctly place containers into their corresponding autoclave bin locations, based on the container IDs. There are functions
added in the code file that are responsible for controlling the movement of the Q-arm to transport the containers. By identifying the correct autoclave bins, the
project aims to use this system to recycle containers into the correct bins based on the container type.
